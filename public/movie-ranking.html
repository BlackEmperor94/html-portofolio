<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr> 
<h3>Se7en (1994)</h3>

The best detective film of all time.

<h3>Drive (2011)</h3>

Amazing cinematography, influenced by 80's neo noir aesthetics.

<h3>Le Samourai (1967)</h3>

The proto neo-noir movie in my opinion. Perfectly minimalistic and dream-like atmosphere.
